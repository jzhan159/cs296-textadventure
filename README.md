Description:

  This is a collaborative CS296 text adventure game project written in Clojure, contributed by Zeran and Jimin together.

  In this little text adventure game, you are going to play the role of a pilot of space ship in the long future, with his ship attacked and abandoned. Filled with alien enemies, danger, mysteries and adventure, will you be able to survive the enemy attack and protect your homeland from them...? Use your braveness, imagination, wisdom and creativity, to solve the puzzles, grab gears, and fight the enemies. Let's hurry up! Time does not wait!

Requirements Fullfillment:

  1. There are around 15 rooms full of joy and happiness awaiting you to explore.
  2. 23 commands including hidden bonus/surprise, detailed below.
  3. Puzzle is very hard, so key is provided at the end of page.
  4. There are multiple items/tools on the map, use you imagination on them.
  5. Try to grab some gold/money on the ground. It's fun. (I'm not gonna tell you it's important.)
  6. On the abandoned ship there is only you alive. But interaction with enemy (kill) is supported.
